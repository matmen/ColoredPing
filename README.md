# ColoredPING
This is a plugin i made for an old Minecraft server.  
It modifies the server's version string to be colorful and allows you to set a custom MOTD from within the game.  
It probably doesn't work anymore, because I haven't worked on it in ~2 years and the protocols and dependencies probably changed.
